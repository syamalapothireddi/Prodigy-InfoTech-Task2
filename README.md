Welcome to my submission for Task 02 of the Software Development Internship at Prodigy Infotech.
In this task, I developed a Number Guessing Game that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it correctly with feedback provided after each attempt.

Task Description
Task 02: Create a Guessing Game

The objective of this task is to build a program that:

Generates a random number within a specified range

Prompts the user to input their guess

Compares the user’s guess with the generated number

Provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low

Continues until the correct number is guessed

Displays the total number of attempts taken by the user

🎯 Game Features

Random number generation

Interactive user input

Continuous feedback loop

Attempt counter

Clear success message on winning

🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

Python – Core programming language

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code – Development environment

Programming Concepts Applied

Conditional statements

Loops

Random number generation

User input handling

Counters and control flow

🔍 Program Workflow
1️⃣ Random Number Generation

Generates a random number within a predefined range

2️⃣ User Interaction

Prompts the user to enter their guess

Accepts multiple attempts until the correct guess

3️⃣ Feedback System

Informs the user whether the guess is:

Too high

Too low

4️⃣ Game Completion

Ends when the correct number is guessed

Displays the total number of attempts

📊 Example Gameplay

Generated Number: (Hidden)

User Inputs:

Guess 1 → Too Low

Guess 2 → Too High

Guess 3 → Correct 🎉

Output:

Congratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.

Conclusion

This task enhanced my understanding of loops, conditional logic, and interactive program design. The Guessing Game is simple yet engaging, demonstrating how basic programming concepts can be used to create an interactive application.
